# Coverage_Project
- Manually created two high coverage test suites, one for each of two languages spanning different application domains
- and programming languages which provided overall coverage and created new images. 
- Developed a debugging support tool by implementing delta debugging to minimize “interesting”
- sets which resulted in the reduction of effort associated with software maintenance
